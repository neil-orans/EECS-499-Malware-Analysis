### EECS 499 Independent Study, Fall 2017 Semester


In the Fall of 2015, students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Instituteâ€™s Department of Computer Science developed and ran a course called Malware Analysis. The course was primarily based off the textbook Practical Malware Analysis by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig, and aimed to teach students skills ranging from reverse engineering of basic malware to advanced dynamic analysis of APTs.  The course materials (lab assignments, project specifications, and lecture slides) were made open-source and [placed on GitHub](https://github.com/RPISEC/Malware).

As my EECS 499 independent study under Professor Peter Honeyman, I will be completing the lab exercises and projects for the Malware Analysis course. All deliverables for the independent study will be uploaded to this repository. Any questions regarding the above should be directed to norans@umich.edu.
